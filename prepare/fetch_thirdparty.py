"""Fetch a third-party Qwen3.8-27B checkpoint in this repo's served shape and
say what to run next. The default is the worked example this script shipped
with (PR #37): philbert440/Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-Aggressive-W4A16-AWQ, an AWQ
quant of the de-refused Qwen3.8-27B with the vision tower and the grafted MTP
head preserved.

  venv/bin/python prepare/fetch_thirdparty.py [hf-repo] [dst_dir]
  # default: philbert440/... -> models/Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-W4A16

~18.6 GB for the default. A checkpoint like it is NOT servable on 24 GB as it
ships, for the same reason the base model is not (bf16 lm_head, bf16
embeddings, bf16 MTP module) -- and the three prepare/quant_*.py scripts
cannot fix a single-shard asymmetric-AWQ export; prepare/quant_heads_stream.py
handles both. This script prints the exact commands when the download finishes.
(A ready-made alternative needing none of this is listed in the README's
"Third-party checkpoints" section.)
