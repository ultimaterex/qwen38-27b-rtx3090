# Batch mode

For serving many concurrent requests: API backends, data processing pipelines,
eval runs. Tuned for aggregate tokens per second, not per-request latency.

## Benchmarks

`vllm bench serve`, random dataset, 256 requests, RTX 3090 at 250 W, default
config (fp16 recurrent state, int8 activations on the MLP GEMMs):

| workload | steady-state decode | output tok/s (e2e) | median TPOT | median TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 256/256, 1 concurrent | 46 | 46 | 21.7 ms | 230 ms |
| 128/512, 64 concurrent | **~1,094** | 942 | 62.2 ms | 3.0 s* |
| 256/256, 64 concurrent | ~1,094 | 673 | 81.4 ms | 3.4 s* |

(Baseline measured on vLLM 0.27.1; re-run after the v0.28.0 upgrade. Two passes each were
within 0.4% of one another. The 128/512 row read 876 when this repo was first published — the difference is everything that landed
since. `INT8_LAYERS=.` — int8 activations on every linear, not just the MLP — reaches
**1,042 tok/s** e2e and ~1,222 steady-state decode, but needs `GPU_UTIL=0.95`: it OOMs inside
the GDN chunk kernel at the 0.972 default. Quality cost of that row: +3.7% perplexity,
[docs/quality.md](../docs/quality.md).)

*TTFT at saturation is queue time — the bench fires all requests at once.

"Steady-state decode" is what the engine logs as generation throughput once
all 64 requests are resident and no prefill is interleaved; the e2e number
includes everybody's prefill and the ramp. Older configs, same protocol:

| config | e2e 128/512 | e2e 256/256 | steady decode |
|---|---|---|---|
| W4A16, fp32 state (only 37 of 64 requests could run) | 516 | 393 | ~585 |
| W4A16, fp16 state | 707 | 491 | ~830 |
| int8 activations, gate/up only (`INT8_LAYERS=gate_up`) | 787 | 572 | ~930 |
| int8 activations, MLP (default) | 876 | 642 | ~1,050 |
| int8 activations, all linears (`INT8_LAYERS=.`) | 1,025 | 752 | ~1,150 |

Quality of each row is in the [quality tables](../docs/quality.md).

Cohort protocol on realistic prompts (C concurrent chat requests, 1,024-token
answers, model-default sampling; comparable to the
[single-user tables](../single-user/README.md)):

| Cohort | e2e throughput | decode throughput | mean TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | 45.4 tok/s | 45.6 tok/s | 110 ms |
| C2 | 81.8 tok/s | 83.7 tok/s | 197 ms |
| C4 | 153.8 tok/s | 162.7 tok/s | 343 ms |
| C8 | 298.4 tok/s | 321.0 tok/s | 638 ms |

Below ~C8, single-user mode's speculative decoding is faster (2.5× at C1 with
the fast variant); batch mode pulls ahead from C8 and keeps scaling to C64.
Re-measured after the single-user sampler / attention patches went in
(2026-08-18): 882 / 635 tok/s e2e at 64 concurrent, cohorts 44.7 / 82.6 /
165.6 / 298.5 — unchanged within noise; the patches only touch small-batch
paths.

### Prefill

Measured with 1-token outputs so it's pure prompt processing. Batch mode
default (int8 tensor cores on the MLP GEMMs):

| input length | conc 1 | conc 4 | conc 8-16 | single-request TTFT |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1k | 1,812 tok/s | 1,820 | 1,806 | 0.56 s |
| 4k | 1,758 | 1,757 | 1,747 | 2.3 s |
| 16k | 1,595 | 1,601 | 1,599 | 10.3 s |
| 64k | 1,182 | 1,184 | — | 55 s |
| 100k | 997 | — | — | 103 s |

Single-user mode (dflash2 k=15, `PREFIX_CACHE=1`), re-measured 2026-09-01 on
the **seeded** protocol — `bench/run_benchmarks.sh` now passes a distinct
`--seed` per call; the unseeded harness this table was first built with let
the prefix cache partially serve repeated bench prompts, which read one config
15-20% low and another 3× high, so the old W4A16 rows here are not comparable:

| input length, conc 1 | W4A16 (mode default) | `INT8_ACT=int8` (all linears) |
|---|---|---|
| 1k | 1,437 tok/s (TTFT 0.71 s) | **1,845** (0.55 s) |
| 4k | 1,494 (2.7 s) | **1,937** (2.1 s) |
| 16k | 1,410 (11.6 s) | **1,791** (9.1 s) |
| 51k | 1,200 (42.6 s) | **1,423** (35.8 s) |

Decode at C1 is unchanged by the int8 path (122±5 vs 121 tok/s over repeats);
quality is the documented int8 trade
([docs/optimizations.md](../docs/optimizations.md), GSM8K 95.0 vs 96.5, PPL
+4.1%). `SPEC=off` and `PREFIX_CACHE=0` each measure ~20% *slower* prefill
than the dflash2 defaults — the drafter rides the V2 model runner and the
prefix-cache path is the fast allocation path — so neither is a "lean" prefill
configuration.

Two things to plan capacity around. First, concurrency does nothing for
prefill: chunked prefill feeds everything through the same 2,048-token
per-step budget, so prompt processing is a fixed resource the whole server
shares, and queueing is linear (four 16k prompts at once means the last one
waits ~40 s). Second, the falloff with length is mild — ~45% from 1k to 100k
on the int8 path, ~34% on W4A16 — because just 16 of 64 layers pay quadratic
attention; this is one of the places the hybrid architecture genuinely helps.

### Raw-engine cells (no speculation, no prefix caching)

For apples-to-apples comparison with other 3090 stacks, the standard "raw"
protocol people ask for: `SPEC=off PREFIX_CACHE=0`, 7,681-token prompts,
511-token generations (8,192 tokens resident per request), C simultaneous
requests, distinct seeds per call. PP = total prompt tokens / wall time of
1-token-output runs at the same concurrency; TG = C × 1000 / mean TPOT
(true tokens per second — with speculation off every round emits exactly one
token per request). RTX 3090 at 250 W, this checkpoint (W4A16-AutoRound-fast).

| cell | W4A16 raw: PP / TG-agg | + server-side int8 (`INT8_ACT=int8 PREFILL_ATTN=int8`): PP / TG-agg |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | 1,172 / 46.9 tok/s | **1,849** / 45.2 |
| C4 | 1,168 / 94.8 | **1,858** / 110.1 |
| C8 | 1,169 / 111.5 | **1,911** / 143.7 |

PP is flat in C because chunked prefill feeds every request through the same
per-step token budget. The int8 column is still "raw" by the usual definition
— no draft model, no cache reuse — it is a server-side kernel choice, the
same class of decision as picking a weight quant. A sanity check for anyone
comparing TG numbers: at true spec-off, `TG per stream x round latency = 1`
token per round. A C1 cell reporting ~110 TG at a ~45 ms round is emitting
~5 tokens per round — that is a speculative path still active (this repo's
own `SPEC=off` used to silently fall through to MTP; see the launcher
comment), not raw decode. Raw single-stream decode for 16 GB of weights on a
936 GB/s card is bounded near ~50 tok/s.

## Shared prompts: `PREFIX_CACHE=1`

If every request carries the same system prompt, few-shot block or document — the normal
shape of an API backend — turn on prefix caching (`--enable-prefix-caching
--mamba-cache-mode align`, opt-in upstream for hybrid models). The attention KV of the shared
prefix is reused and the recurrent (GDN) state resumes from the last cached block boundary,
so the prefix is prefilled once instead of once per request:

| 64 requests sharing a 5,820-token system prompt, concurrency 32 | wall | output | median latency | p90 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| default | 222.2 s | 10.6 tok/s | 94.9 s | 155.3 s |
| `PREFIX_CACHE=1` | **16.9 s** | **133.9 tok/s** | **8.0 s** | **15.2 s** |

It costs ~14% of the KV pool (223,821 → 193,298 tokens, 1.29x concurrency at 150k instead of
1.49x) — one extra recurrent-state page per request — and nothing on workloads with no shared
prefix (870 tok/s on the 128 in / 512 out row, i.e. unchanged). Answers are identical; the
state resume is exact.

One failure mode to know about on mixed workloads (a long-running conversation
plus unrelated traffic on the same server): a hybrid cache hit needs the mamba
group's retained state snapshot *and* the attention blocks, and stock vLLM's
eviction order kills the snapshot first — one lost block and the whole
conversation re-prefills at 0% hit even though its attention KV is fully
cached. `patches/mamba-align-checkpoint-order.patch` (in the standard patch
set, default off) fixes the ordering when enabled with
`VLLM_MAMBA_ALIGN_KEEP_CHECKPOINTS=1`; mechanism, measurements and the
capacity caveat are in [docs/gotchas.md](../docs/gotchas.md) #49.

## Setup

Do the [common setup](../README.md#setup) first (venv, model download,
requantization, vLLM patches). Then:

```bash
bash batch/start_qwen.sh
```

Or in Docker (image build, model prep and the same knobs via `.env` — see the
[docs/docker.md](../docs/docker.md)):

```bash
docker compose --profile batch up -d
```

Or as a service:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp batch/qwen-serving.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now qwen-serving
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

First start takes a few minutes (torch.compile, CUDA graph capture, flashinfer
JIT). Watch `qwen.log` in the repo root; it's up when you see
"HTTP server started".

## Knobs

All overridable as env vars, defaults in the script:

| var | default | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PREFIX_CACHE` | 0 | 1 = reuse a shared prompt prefix across requests (see above): 13x on shared-prompt workloads, ~14% smaller KV pool |
| `KV` | `fp8` | `kvarn` switches to the KVarN 4/2-bit KV cache (run `bash kvarn/install.sh` once): 262k context, ~2× the token pool, slower decode — see the main README's "262k context" section |
| `INT8_ACT` | `int8` | int8 activations on the Marlin GEMMs (int8 tensor cores, weights stay int4). Empty string = plain W4A16 |
| `INT8_LAYERS` | `mlp` | regex on the layer name that gets int8 activations. `gate_up` for the gentle variant, `.` for everything, or a hand-picked list from `bench/act_calib.py` |
| `MAX_SEQS` | 64 | scheduler slots; with fp16 state ~70 short requests fit the page pool |
| `MAX_LEN` | 150000 | max context. Raising it much past this fails startup, the pool can't hold a longer request |
| `TOOLS` | 1 | tool/function calling (`--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser`). `TOOL_PARSER` (`qwen3_coder`) must match the XML call format this model's chat template emits — `hermes` parses the JSON a Qwen model does *not* produce here, and fails silently. 0 = off, and `tool_choice: "auto"` then 400s |
| `PORT` | 18020 | |
| `GPU_UTIL` | 0.972 | do not raise, see gotchas in the main README. Use 0.93 when you want `prompt_logprobs` (quality checks) |
| `KV_OFFLOAD_GB` | unset (off) | CPU KV-cache offload tier, vLLM's native `OffloadingConnector` (0.27.1+): overflowed KV blocks move to pinned host RAM instead of being dropped, transferred back over PCIe on a later prefix-cache hit instead of recomputed. GiB of host RAM to give the tier. Requires `PREFIX_CACHE=1` (refused otherwise) and forces `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False` — boot-tested against this mode's own `expandable_segments:True`/`GPU_UTIL=0.972` requirement (single-user/README.md's gotcha 4 territory) and found clean, but only at a single idle request; re-verify under real 64-concurrent load before trusting it there. No speculative decoding in this mode means no drafter sliding-window group, so it doesn't hit the KVarN asymmetric-block-size bug that makes this ineffective on `single-user`'s `CTX=huge` (see that README's `KV_OFFLOAD_GB` row, gotcha 42) |

## Verify you're getting the numbers

```bash
bash verify.sh                       # install + patches + model + live server sanity
bash bench/run_benchmarks.sh batch   # the tables above (--prefill / --long for the rest)
```

or by hand:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=$(cat api_key.txt) venv/bin/vllm bench serve \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18020 \
  --model models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound \
  --served-model-name qwen3.8-27b \
  --dataset-name random --random-input-len 128 --random-output-len 512 \
  --num-prompts 256 --max-concurrency 64
```

Run it twice, keep the second number. The first run after a restart includes
JIT warmup and reads 30-50% low. Then run `bench/quality_battery.py` — a
throughput number from a server that emits garbage is worth nothing, and the
int8 path taught us that the hard way.
