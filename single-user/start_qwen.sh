# Qwen3.8-27B on a single RTX 3090 — SINGLE USER / LOW LATENCY mode.
#
# Same base config as batch mode, plus MTP speculative decoding: the checkpoint
# keeps Qwen's multi-token-prediction head, so the model drafts 3-4 tokens ahead
# and verifies them in one pass. Measured on realistic chat prompts with the
# `-fast` model variant (see "Fast variant" below): ~114 tok/s at the model's
# default sampling, ~124 tok/s greedy (vs 46 tok/s without speculation).
# What makes 4 drafts pay off, in order of importance:
#  - the drafter scores a 40k-token draft head (prepare/build_draft_vocab.py) — and the
#    id list matters: a vocabulary counted over the model's OWN outputs covers
#    97.5% of what it generates (96% on code); the earlier web-text list only 92%
#    (83% on code), and every miss is a forced rejection (108 vs 98 tok/s greedy)
#  - the MTP module and lm_head requantized to int4 with GPTQ calibrated on the
#    model's hidden states (drafter/): 850 -> 215 MB per draft, 1.27 -> 0.65 GB
#    lm_head per verify, +0.6% perplexity, acceptance unchanged
#  - patches/spec-decode-attn.patch: split-KV attention for the 5-query verify
#    step (FA2 leaves 58 of 82 SMs idle there); patches/sampler-...: sort-free
#    top-k, multi-block softmax, drafts truncated to the target's top-k/top-p
#  - draft_sample_method=probabilistic: drafts are sampled, not argmax'ed, which
#    lifts acceptance at temperature > 0
# Speculative decoding is exact: none of this changes what gets sampled.
#
# CTX=fast (default here): FlashAttention + bf16 KV, 4 drafts, 64k context.
# CTX=long: fp8 KV via FlashInfer, 150k context, 3 drafts (k=4 crashes on
#   FlashInfer as soon as one request finishes while another is mid-generation,
#   vLLM 0.27.1); the split-KV attention patch is bf16-KV only, so ~90/98 tok/s.
# CTX=huge: KVarN 4/2-bit KV cache (kvarn/), 200k context with MTP, at roughly
#   half the decode rate past 100k — see below and docs/long-context.md.
#
# Fast variant: MODEL defaults to models/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound-fast when it
# exists (int4-GPTQ lm_head + MTP, own-output draft vocab; drafter/README.md), else
# the base dir (int8 lm_head/MTP: ~108/107 tok/s with the shipped draft vocab).
#
# max-num-seqs is 8 here: fewer state slots to reserve (each request holds
# k+1 recurrent-state slots), and past a handful of concurrent users you
# should be running batch mode anyway. Int8 activations are pointless at
# batch size 1 (memory-bound), so this mode stays W4A16.

  # re-measured with his method. The number that is not in dispute is the long-context
  # one above, where the gap is 3.5x and no amount of step-count matching closes it.
  # Read that -13..18% as SHORT PROMPTS ONLY. Past 8k the two modes are within
  # noise on bare metal (8k/16k/32k/50k: 112/78/69/58 FULL vs 109/86/73/56
  # PIECEWISE), so PIECEWISE is close to free at the lengths this mode is for.
  # Under GPU passthrough on a VM it costs 2-3x instead (PR #13): the uncaptured
  # verify is launch-bound, and launches are not free there.
  # The capture mode is fixed at boot, so CTX=huge takes the trade. Treat
  # CUDAGRAPH_MODE=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE as unsafe: what it does is corrupt one
  # prompt length in every 128 (gotcha 37, bench/bugb_sweep.py), which a coarse
  # sweep reads as a length threshold and a lucky sweep misses entirely.
  # This is NOT dflash2-only, which is what we used to claim here. SPEC=mtp with
  # CTX=huge captured FULL by default and has the same bug: at the residue that
  # matches its 4-token verify block it stops immediately, returning "" or "#"
  # with finish_reason=stop while every other residue is 794/794 verbatim. The
  # broken residue is R = 117 + k: 124 at DFLASH_TOKENS=7, 122 at 5, 120 at 3,
  # and the same 120 under mtp k=3. Equivalently the last 128-token tile has
  # 11-k free slots, i.e. verify block + free = 12 in every config measured.
  # k=5 is what rules out the attention block size as the driver -- same 2176
  # block as k=7, different residue. mtp and dflash2 at the same draft count
  # break identically, so the drafter is not implicated and every KVarN
  # speculator reaches it. It also needs a prefix-cache HIT to
  # fire at all, which is why PREFIX_CACHE=0 always looked clean (PR #13).
  # Correctness first, and it is close to free for MTP as well -- same depth
  # ladder, only the capture toggled, 8k/16k/32k/50k:
  #   FULL      87.8 / 86.1 / 70.4 / 63.5 tok/s
  #   PIECEWISE 93.5 / 83.8 / 70.3 / 59.6 tok/s
  # so PIECEWISE now covers the whole of CTX=huge, not just dflash2. The old
  # claim here that forcing it "would cost decode for nothing" was wrong twice.
  # SPEC=mtp keeps PIECEWISE for CORRECTNESS, not preference. Do not "optimise" this
  # away: under FULL, mtp at CTX=huge still breaks at one prompt length in 128 --
  # templated length == L (mod 128), L = k+1 = 4 -- with a prefix cache hit. Measured on
  # current main, fresh server, residues 3/4/5:
  #   residue 3   794/794    residue 4   0 chars, finish_reason=stop    residue 5   794/794
  # The LOCATION is deterministic; the DAMAGE is not. The same residue has returned an
  # empty answer here, a one-character answer, and -- on a third geometry (MAX_LEN=240000,
  # tool parser attached) -- 400 tokens of fluent Danish inventing a translation task,
  # 2 of 1146 characters matching the document. So do not test for a symptom; test
  # whether the copy came back (bench/verbatim.py).
  # @mjungnickel18 found it by sweeping all 128 residues (127 clean, one broken, and it
  # is 4); an earlier version of this comment claimed mtp was "correct under FULL" on
  # five sampled residues that did not include 4 -- five distinct samples miss a single
  # broken residue C(127,5)/C(128,5) = 123/128 = 96% of the time, not the 82% this
  # comment used to say. a75ee4b fixed the same shape for dflash2 but does not
  # cover this path.
  #
  # dflash2 does get FULL, and to the same evidence standard: ALL 128 residues swept
  # under FULL, self-hit measured, 0 broken -- so this is not the five-sample luck the
  # mtp claim was. On top of that FULL is 96.5% GSM8K against PIECEWISE's 95.0%, and
  # worth 2-3x under GPU passthrough (PR #13), where the uncaptured verify is
  # launch-bound rather than bandwidth-bound. THAT one is a preference and may be

# fp16 activations do not work with the speculative path, and the way you find that out
# is late and cryptic (#27): the split-KV verify kernel hardcodes tl.bfloat16 for the
# query cast and the dot accumulate (patches/spec-decode-attn.patch:217,236), so it
# fails to *compile* at first attention with "Both operands must be same dtype. Got bf16
# and fp16" -- a triton CompilationError that never names the dtype you set.
#
# Scope, stated honestly because an earlier version of this comment overreached: the
# BLOCKER I can point at is that kernel. @ahnguyen17 also hit a device-side assert in
# rejection_sample() with SPEC_ATTN=0, and I first wrote that up as a second bf16
# assumption -- it is not. rejection_sampler_utils.py contains zero bf16/fp16 literals;
# it promotes to tl.float32 on load and allocates its buffers float32/int64, so it is
# dtype-agnostic. That assert has some other cause (it was seen on a w8a16 GPTQ target
# whose GEMM path was already suspect, and a device-side assert reads like an
# out-of-bounds index, not a dtype mismatch), and it is not established.
#
# So this refuses the combination rather than claiming to enumerate why it breaks:
