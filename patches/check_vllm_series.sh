# Validate the patch series against a pristine vLLM 0.28.0 checkout.
#
# Two passes, because two tools are in play and they answer different questions:
#
#   1. Every patch, in the glob order the Dockerfile and the README use, applied
#      with GNU `patch` -- the tool that actually installs this stack. This is
#      the pass that says "a clone of this repo still builds". It was missing
#      entirely until 2026-09-07; the job checked five of thirty files.
#   2. The five DFlash patches whose order and hunk metadata are part of the
#      0.28.0 contract, applied with `git apply`, which is strict about offsets
#      and catches a hand-edited hunk header immediately.
#
# Five patches are accepted by GNU patch and rejected by git apply once the
# patches before them have moved their context. That is why pass 1 uses GNU
# patch: the installed tree is produced by GNU patch, so GNU patch defines
# "applies", and git apply stays on the five where hunk metadata is contractual.
